In order to assess how animals and plants react to environmental changes, spatially and temporally high-resolution information on their species composition, numbers of individuals and possible reactions and interactions is required. Efforts are therefore being made to increasingly replace traditional survey methods with automated monitoring and to collect information directly at the study sites using sensors. This course aims to provide an insight into this rapidly developing field and the various ecological, technical and data-related aspects involved.  Its primary objective is to cultivate critical thinking skills and foster discussions among students.


# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able to
  * Know the most important components and sensor types
  * Understand the requirements of a monitoring system
  * Describe basic codes for controlling the sensor
  * Describe the basic concepts of data acquisition, storage and analysis
  * Evaluate the limitations of different methods
  * Document the steps required to build a sensor box

MSc students should also be able to develop and present a project to improve one aspect of a Proximate Sensor.


# Setting

This course will take place in a synchronous setting in presence in room **F 14 | 00A19** with the options of visiting real-world examples of proximate sensors around the city.

<!--
This course will take place in a hybrid setting with a digital classroom and additional students being present in person in the physical classroom (**F 14 | 00A19**).
Details on this synchronous hybrid classroom format will be provided in the first session, which will take place **in presence only on Tuesday 25.10.2022 at 9:15 am**.
The link to the digital classroom of the first session is provided in the [Ilias course environment](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2593121&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"} (only accessible for members of the course who are logged-in into Ilias). 
Please also seriously check and follow the [Information on the Coronavirus](https://www.uni-marburg.de/de/universitaet/administration/sicherheit/coronavirus){:target="_blank"} of the University of Marburg.

# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on an project report presented either as written report or as a personal repository on GitHub. 
Additionally, there will be a 12 minute presentation on a recent manuscript, followed by a 3 minute discussion.
