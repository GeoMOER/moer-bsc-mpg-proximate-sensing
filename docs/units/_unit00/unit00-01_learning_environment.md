<!--
Our first course session will be virtual. Details on the virtual classroom and how to get there are provided on the front page and were send by email to all participants.
Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg.

## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub. ChatGPT and deepl were used to convey ideas more efficently.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help. 
The structure is linear, so just work your way through it in parallel to the course.
Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.

In order not to limit the discussion in advance, some of these theoretical foundations should only be looked at when you are asked to do so in the course. These contents are marked as spoilers. 

Please also not that the HTML learning environment has a FAQ page for recurring questions and a comment functionality on the first page of each unit.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. 
We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents.
The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_3897879&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Note that you have to log in with your student account. There is also a forum in Ilias, which you can use for getting in touch with your fellow students.
