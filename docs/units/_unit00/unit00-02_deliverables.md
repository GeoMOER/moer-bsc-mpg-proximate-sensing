## Assignments
We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Pr√ºfungsleistung"). 
Both are required for passing the course but only the latter are marked.

Your unmarked assignment will be to present a paper on recent developments in the world of proximity sensing in the form of a 12 minute presentation followed by a 3 minute discussion. Everybody is requested to prepare 3 questions for the topic of each of your peers.

Your marked assignment will be to prepare a project work consisting of a 1-2 page introduction, 3-5 pages of description (depends on the project), and 2 pages of discussion. This assignment can also be presented in form of a github page.
