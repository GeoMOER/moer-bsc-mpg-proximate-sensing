In June, if the weather is fine, part of our course and course projects involves visiting and setting up sensor boxes in the Marburg area. 
Be aware of the risk of sunburn and tick-borne diseases and protect yourself accordingly:

**1.** Sunscreen is your friend! Don't forget to lather up and protect your skin.

**2.** Keep your head covered to shield yourself from the sun's rays.

**3.** Long trousers with socks tucked in can help prevent tick bites.

**4.** Opt for light-colored clothing to make spotting ticks easier.

**5.** Stay hydrated by bringing plenty of water along.

By taking these precautions, we can ensure our fieldwork remains safe and comfortable. Looking forward to exploring together!
