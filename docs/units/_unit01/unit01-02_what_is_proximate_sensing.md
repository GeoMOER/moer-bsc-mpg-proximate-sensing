The title of this course refers to several aspects:

__Proximate__ as discussed prior, proximate denotes something immediate or direct, as opposed to something distant or remote. The word "proximate" originates from the Latin word "proximatus," which is the past participle of "proximare," meaning "to approach" or "to draw near." In English, "proximate" is used to describe something that is nearest in space, time, order, or relation.

__Sensing__: "Sensing" refers to the process of detecting or perceiving stimuli or signals from the environment. The Latin verb "sentire" means "to feel" or "to perceive". In technology, sensing involves the ability to detect and interpret information through specialized devices.


When combining these two aspects alone, proximate sensing refers to the detection and measurement of  properties or phenomena in the immediate vicinity of a sensor.


**QUESTIONS TO BE DISCUSSED**
> What are some examples of applications of proximate sensing?


In this course, we will focus on the _ecologcial_ properties, adding the third aspect Biodiversity: 

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines biodiversity as follows: "Biodiversity means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems." Therefore, there are generally three levels of biodiversity- genetic diversity, species  diversity, diversity of ecosystems- genetic variability within and between populations, which is a basis for evolutionary processes.

**QUESTIONS TO BE DISCUSSED**
> can proximate sensing cover all aspects of biodiversity?
> what are the limits?
