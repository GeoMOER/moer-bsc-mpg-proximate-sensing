## Class-Discussion:
> You'll receive coloured cards from your instructor.

> Before you start reading the next chapters, take 10 minutes to think about the different components needed to make a proximate sensing device work, and which other non-technical aspects are relevant in your opinion. Take notes.

> Next, sit with a classmate who has the same card colour as you. Discuss your ideas and summarise them by writing the components/non-technical aspects separately on the cards. This will take ~ 15 minutes.

> After a short break, we will collect and discuss the ideas to construct a proximate sensing device on paper
