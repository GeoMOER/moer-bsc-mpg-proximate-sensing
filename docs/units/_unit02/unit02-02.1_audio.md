Acoustic sensors, such as microphones or hydrophones, record sounds produced by animals, including vocalizations, mating calls, and other bioacoustic signals.

Animal vocalizations typically exhibit distinctive spectral characteristics, such as frequency range, duration, and amplitude modulation patterns. Analyzing these spectral features can help differentiate between different species or individual animals.

Once recordings are made, researchers analyze the audio data using specialized software capable of detecting and classifying sounds of interest. This process often involves the use of machine learning algorithms trained to recognize specific animal vocalizations based on their acoustic features.

ARUs are typically equipped with microphones capable of capturing sounds within a specific frequency range. These microphones can vary depending on the application, with omnidirectional or directional microphones being commonly used.
