Let's learn by examples!

1)  Reverse engineering:
    De-construct the **A**utomated **M**oth **T**rap, which is the 2nd version of the AMT used in [this publication](https://resjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/icad.12662). Document every step with photos and short texts. 
    - What are the single components used for? (use e.g. google lens or similar tools)  
    - Which GPIO number is triggering the UV light?  
    - Which GPIO number is triggering the flash?  

2)  Read the Chapters **Introduction** and **Hardware** of the [Insect Detect DIY camera](https://maxsitt.github.io/insect-detect-docs/hardware/) by M. Sittinger.

3)  Compare both trap systems with your ideal trap and discuss the pros and cons of the components (Group discussion)
