# Power Management and Battery Choices for Raspberry Pi

The control unit and all additional electronic components need power. A standard Raspberry Pi lacks advanced power management features. By default, the Raspberry Pi is designed to run continuously, consuming a consistent amount of power whether it is actively used or not. Even in idle states, the Raspberry Pi and its peripherals (like USB devices) continue to draw power, which is inefficient for long-term remote deployments without a regular power supply. The power consumption when idle can range from 220 mA to 540 mA, depending on the version of the Raspberry Pi ([source](https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/power-consumption)). This can quickly deplete batteries in field deployments – even without anything running!

## Calculating Runtime with a Power Bank

To estimate the runtime, use the following formula:

```r
Estimated Runtime (hours) = (Power Bank Capacity in mAh) / (Device Consumption in mA)
```

This is an ideal calculation and assumes 100% efficiency in energy transfer, which in reality is lower due to losses in voltage conversion and other inefficiencies. A typical power bank might have an efficiency around 80% to 90%.

### Adjusted for Efficiency

So, if we adjust for an 85% efficiency:

```r
Adjusted Runtime (hours) = (Power Bank Capacity in mAh * 0.85) / (Device Consumption in mA)
```

This means, for a device consuming 300 mA, a 10,000 mAh power bank could potentially power it for approximately 28.33 hours under typical conditions. The runtime will vary based on the actual power consumption of the device and the efficiency of the power bank.

## Power Management with Sleepy Pi

If possible, add some power management such as Sleepy Pi. Sleepy Pi is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi designed to manage power efficiently, especially in scenarios where power conservation is crucial, such as in remote sensor deployments. The Sleepy Pi employs a low-power microcontroller (typically an Arduino-compatible chip) that runs independently of the Raspberry Pi. This microcontroller can remain active at very low power consumption levels to monitor sensors, manage power, and decide when to wake up the Raspberry Pi. This allows the Raspberry Pi to be turned off completely and then powered back – either at regular intervals (e.g., every hour or once a day) to perform tasks like data collection, processing, or transmission or in response to specific events, like a sensor trigger. This means the Raspberry Pi is only active when needed, which drastically reduces power consumption compared to leaving the Raspberry Pi running continuously.

## Battery Selection

Select a battery or power bank with enough capacity to meet your needs. For a Raspberry Pi, a power bank with a 5V output and sufficient mAh rating (often ranging from 10,000 to 20,000 mAh for extended operations) is suitable. If you add other 5V devices, you have to add their consumption to your calculations. When controlling 12V devices with a Raspberry Pi through a relay, the setup becomes more complex. You can either use two power sources, one for the 5V devices and one for the 12 V devices, or use converters to power both devices by the same battery. For example, if you have a 12V automotive battery, and you need to power devices that require 5V, such as a Raspberry Pi, you'll need a step-down converter that can take the 12V input from the automotive battery and convert it to a stable 5V output suitable for the Raspberry Pi. Ensure the converter can provide enough current for your Raspberry Pi and any peripherals attached to it. For instance, if your Raspberry Pi setup consumes about 1A at 5V, the converter should be rated for at least 1A at 5V output. Since converters are not 100% efficient, it’s good practice to choose one with a bit higher current capacity than your maximum expected load.

Ensure the power bank or battery has proper protection against overcharge, over-discharge, and short-circuiting. Many commercial power banks include these protections, which are vital for safe operation in the field.

### Potential Batteries

#### Lead-Acid Batteries

- **Weight:** These are generally the heaviest among common battery types due to their lead and electrolyte contents.
- **Fire Hazard:** Low risk under normal conditions but can release harmful gases if overcharged or damaged.
- **Price:** Generally the least expensive option, making them popular for high-capacity needs, such as automotive use.
- **Production Impact:** Lead-acid batteries are heavy and use lead, a toxic heavy metal, which has significant environmental and health impacts during mining and production.
- **Recycling:** They have a high recycling rate due to the value of lead, but the process can still be environmentally hazardous if not properly managed.
- **Cycle Life:** Deep-cycle lead-acid batteries can last for 400 to 1,500 cycles. Regular or starter lead-acid batteries, often used in cars, might have fewer cycles, typically around 300 to 500 cycles, as they are not designed for deep discharge.

#### Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) Batteries

- **Weight:** Much lighter than lead-acid batteries, offering a high energy density.
- **Fire Hazard:** Higher risk of fires or explosions if damaged or improperly charged due to thermal runaway.
- **Price:** More expensive than lead-acid but popular due to their balance of weight, capacity, and reliability.
- **Production Impact:** The extraction and processing of lithium and other rare metals used in these batteries can be environmentally damaging, involving significant water usage and contributing to habitat destruction.
- **Recycling:** Recycling processes for lithium-ion batteries are improving but are not as widespread or efficient as for other types, resulting in less material recovery.
- **Cycle Life:** Li-ion batteries generally offer a cycle life of around 500 to 1,500 cycles. Advanced formulations and careful management can push this towards 2,000 cycles in some cases.

#### Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries

- **Weight:** Lighter than lead-acid but heavier than lithium-ion for the same energy capacity.
- **Fire Hazard:** Low risk of fire or explosion compared to lithium-ion.
- **Price:** Moderately priced, more expensive than lead-acid but generally cheaper than lithium-ion.
- **Production Impact:** NiMH batteries have a relatively lower environmental impact compared to lithium-based batteries, as they do not contain heavy metals like cadmium or lead.
- **Recycling:** They are easier to recycle than lithium-based batteries and have a well-established recycling process.
- **Cycle Life:** NiMH batteries typically have a cycle life of about 500 to 1,000 cycles. High-quality NiMH batteries may reach up to 1,500 cycles under optimal conditions.

#### Lithium Polymer (Li-Po) Batteries

- **Weight:** Similar to lithium-ion but can be made in ultra-thin formats.
- **Fire Hazard:** Similar or slightly higher fire risks than lithium-ion due to their construction and the materials used.
- **Price:** Generally on par with or slightly higher than lithium-ion batteries, depending on the form factor and application.

Rechargeable batteries like lithium-ion or lithium-polymer are preferred for their high energy density and rechargeability. They do, however, require careful handling and proper charging circuits to minimize fire risks. Lead-Acid is suitable for stationary setups where weight is not an issue and cost is an important factor. They are robust and reliable but bulky. Nickel-Metal Hydride offers a middle ground in terms of weight and safety but may not provide the same energy density as lithium-based batteries, affecting runtime. For shorter missions or backup purposes, alkaline or lithium non-rechargeable batteries might be used due to their longer shelf life and stability in varying temperatures, though of course, this produces a lot of waste.

Some batteries, especially lithium-based ones, have specific safety considerations, both during transport and in the field, due to their risk of thermal runaway or fire. Ensure proper safety mechanisms are in place, and be aware of transportation regulations for lithium batteries.

Battery performance can vary significantly with temperature. Lithium-ion batteries, for instance, perform well across a broad range of temperatures but can degrade quickly in extreme cold or heat. Select batteries rated for the environmental conditions they will face.

Consider the lifespan of the batteries in terms of charge cycles. Rechargeable batteries can degrade over time, reducing their capacity. For long-term deployments, choose batteries with a high cycle life and consider the environmental impact of disposal or recycling.

### Solar Power Integration

By converting sunlight into electricity, solar panels can provide a continuous power supply during daylight hours, and with proper battery integration, they can power devices overnight or during cloudy days. High-efficiency panels can generate more electricity from the same amount of sunlight, which is especially useful in areas with limited sunlight or space for panels. Calculate your device's average daily power consumption to determine the necessary panel size.

#### Calculating Solar and Battery Needs

1. **Calculate Daily Power Needs:** Sum up the power consumption of all components in your sensor box. If a camera consumes 5W and is active for 2 hours a day, and a sensor consumes 0.5W continuously, the total energy needed is:

```r
Total Daily Energy = (Power Consumption of Each Device × Hours Active) + (Continuous Power × 24 hours)
```

For the given example:

```r
Total Energy = (5W × 2h) + (0.5W × 24h) = 10Wh + 12Wh = 22Wh per day
```

2. **Determine Solar Panel Size:** Suppose you have 5 hours of effective sunlight. To meet the daily energy needs of 22Wh, calculate the required panel wattage:

```r
Required Panel Wattage = Total Daily Energy / Effective Sunlight Hours
```

For the example:


```r
Required Panel Wattage = 22Wh / 5h = 4.4W
```


Considering inefficiencies and losses, a 10W panel might be a practical choice.

3. **Battery Sizing:** To cover 3 days of no sunlight, calculate the necessary battery capacity:

Required Battery Capacity = Total Daily Energy × Number of Days Without Sun / Battery Voltage


For the example:

```r
Required Battery Capacity = 22Wh × 3 / 12V = 5.5Ah
```

4. **Monitoring and Management:** Implement battery monitoring to track voltage, current, and temperature. This helps manage the battery's health and predict when replacements or recharges are needed.

5. **Protection Circuitry:** Use protection circuits to prevent overcharging, deep discharging, and short-circuiting, which can all significantly impact battery life and safety.

### Efficiency of Solar Panels

The efficiency of a solar panel determines how much of the sunlight it can convert into usable electricity. Typically, monocrystalline panels have efficiencies between 15-20%, while polycrystalline panels range from 13-16%.

#### Types of Solar Panels

- **Monocrystalline Solar Panels:** Made from a single crystal structure, known for high efficiency and durability. Perform well in low-light conditions and have a long lifespan but are generally more expensive and heavier.
- **Polycrystalline Solar Panels:** Made from multiple crystal structures. Less efficient than monocrystalline panels but cheaper and lighter, making them a good compromise for many applications.
- **Thin-Film Solar Panels:** Lightweight and flexible, suitable for uneven surfaces or where weight is a critical factor. However, they have lower efficiency and a shorter lifespan compared to crystalline panels.

### How Shade Affects Solar Panels

Solar panels are made up of many individual solar cells connected in series within each panel. When a solar cell is shaded, it not only stops producing electricity but can also become a barrier to the current flowing through the panel, significantly reducing the overall power output. This is because the current in a series circuit is limited by the weakest (most shaded) cell.

#### Shade-Resistant Solar Panel Features

1. **Bypass Diodes:** Used in solar panels to allow current to bypass shaded cells, reducing the loss of power. When part of a panel is shaded, the bypass diodes activate, allowing the unshaded cells to continue producing power. This prevents the entire string of cells from being affected by a few shaded ones.
2. **Split-Cell Technology:** Panels with this technology have cells that are split into halves or thirds. This design reduces the impact of shading because only a smaller portion of the cell needs to bypass, allowing more of the panel to remain productive even when partially shaded.
3. **Microinverters and Power Optimizers:** Devices attached to each solar panel or each cell within a panel. Microinverters convert the DC power from each panel to AC power individually, while power optimizers condition the DC power from each panel before it's sent to a central inverter. Both devices ensure that shading on one panel doesn't affect the overall system's performance as significantly.

Do Solar Panels Need Full Sun?

Solar panels perform best under full sun conditions but don't necessarily need full sun to operate. They can still generate electricity under cloudy conditions or indirect light, albeit at reduced efficiency. The impact of shading can be significant; even a small shadow can lead to a substantial drop in energy production.

For optimal performance, it's crucial to:
- **Minimize Shading:** Place panels where they will receive the maximum sun exposure throughout the day. Even partial shading can significantly reduce output.
- **Consider the Solar Path:** Understand the path of the sun throughout the year and arrange panels to minimize times they might be shaded by trees, buildings, or other obstacles.
- **Regular Maintenance:** Keep panels clean and clear of debris, snow, or anything that could cast a shadow and reduce efficiency.

Shade-resistant technologies are particularly valuable in residential areas or wooded locations where complete sun exposure is not always possible. They help ensure that even when some cells are shaded, the overall power loss is minimized, making solar energy more viable in less-than-ideal conditions.

Solar panels and batteries require minimal maintenance but should be checked periodically for dust, debris, or damage that could reduce efficiency. Ensure the panels are durable enough to withstand local weather conditions, including rain, snow, and temperature extremes.

Some areas may have regulations regarding the installation of solar panels, especially in protected wildlife areas. Additionally, consider the environmental impact of the materials used in solar panels and batteries.
